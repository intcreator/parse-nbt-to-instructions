# Parse NBT to Instructions

This is a simple script I made to parse an NBT file generated by [MapartCraft](https://rebane2001.com/mapartcraft/) into instructions that friends can use to create a map without giving away what it is at the beginning.

## Setup

1. Install [nbtlib](https://pypi.org/project/nbtlib/) (Python NBT library)
2. Clone repo
3. Copy your nbt data file to this directory and rename to "mosaic_full.nbt"
4. Run `python3 parse-nbt-to-instructions.py`
